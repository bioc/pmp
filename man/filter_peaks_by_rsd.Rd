\title{Filter features by RSD\% of QC samples}
\usage{
filter_peaks_by_rsd(df, max_rsd, classes, qc_label)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{peak intensity matrix}

\item{max_rsd}{threshold of QC RSD\% value}

\item{classes}{vector of class labels}

\item{qc_label}{class label for QC sample}
}
\value{
list of filtered peak intensity matrix and matrix with flags
}
\description{
Metabolomics datasets often contain 'features' with irreproducible peak 
intensity values, or with large numbers of missing values. This tool 
facilitates the remove of such features from a data matrix, based upon 
relative standard deviation of intensity values for a given feature within 
specified QC samples.

\examples{

attach (testData)
out <- filter_peaks_by_rsd(df=testData$data, max_rsd=20,
    classes=testData$class, qc_label='QC')
