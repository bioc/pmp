}
\arguments{

\value{
list of filtered peak intensity matrix and matrix with flags
}
\description{
Missing values in mass spectrometry metabolomic datasets occur widely and 
can originate from a number of sources, including for both technical and 
biological reasons. In order for robust conclusions to be drawn from 
down-stream statistical testing procedures, the issue of missing values 
must first be addressed. This tool facilitates the removal of samples 
containing a user-defined maximum percentage of missing values.
